# frontend-template

A frontend template project built with Vite


### Run the development server:
Start the development server with:

```npm run dev```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port), and you can view your site in the browser. Vite provides hot module replacement (HMR) out of the box, so any changes you make will be immediately reflected in the browser.

### Build for production:
When you're ready to deploy your project, you can build it for production with:

```npm run build```

### Serve production build:
To preview the production build, you can use Vite's built-in preview command:

```npm run preview```

This will serve the content of the dist/ directory at http://localhost:5000 (or another available port).
